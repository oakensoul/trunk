# The Trunk

This is my space for putting all my common stuff that I want everywhere. Sort of my personal notebook, but also for
things that I always want to make sure I have a central reference to so that I don't duplicate them into every single
repository that I create.




## Contributing
As it mentions in the links below, these are the contributing guidelines that I prefer for my projects. I want to make
a shout out to the [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) project as it has some great
instructions for how to deal with Pull Requests that i've copied inside my contributing file.
